# featureRequests
Feature Request App
Build a web application that allows the user to create &quot;feature requests&quot;.
A &quot;feature request&quot; is a request for a new feature that will be added onto an existing
piece of software. Assume that the user is an employee at _________ who would be
entering this information after having some correspondence with the client that is
requesting the feature. The necessary fields are:
 Title: A short, descriptive name of the feature request.
 Description: A long description of the feature request.
 Client: A selection list of clients (use &quot;Client A&quot;, &quot;Client B&quot;, &quot;Client C&quot;)
 Client Priority: A numbered priority according to the client (1...n). Client Priority
numbers should not repeat for the given client, so if a priority is set on a new
feature as &quot;1&quot;, then all other feature requests for that client should be reordered.
 Target Date: The date that the client is hoping to have the feature.
 Product Area: A selection list of product areas (use &#39;Policies&#39;, &#39;Billing&#39;, &#39;Claims&#39;,
&#39;Reports&#39;)
